# publications_prediction
We are presented with a dataset of one popular social network that includes more than 8.5 million records with meta-information of publications over 13 months (January 2019 to February 2020). Using this data, we will need to predict the number of publications in each 250x250 meter polygon for each hour 4 weeks (28 days) ahead of the last publication in the training set.
